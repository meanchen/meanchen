### Hi there üèÇ

I am currently a graduate student in Harbin Institute of Technology.

As a mechanical engineering student, I believe programming and simulation tools especially machine learning algorithms can bring efficiency and effectiveness to modern industry. Besides, it can also bring us a lot of opportunities to work with people who is talented in computer science, math, economics, and many more fields. I am really interested to exchange my opinion with them, and bring new ideas or simulation methods to industry.

To sum up, I am an active job seeker for working experience that can promote my knowledge of machine learning and data science skills.
